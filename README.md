# Ai-Chatbot
An AI Chatbot web application built using Django, integrating NLP for text-based and voice-based user interaction, powered by a knowledge base about Artificial Intelligence. Supports text and voice input, responds with related knowledge from the knowledge base, and provides a clean interface with speech synthesis.                          

# AI Chatbot - Django Web Application

An AI-powered Chatbot built with **Django**, designed to answer questions related to Artificial Intelligence. The chatbot supports both **text input** and **voice input**, provides responses by searching a predefined knowledge base, and speaks answers using **text-to-speech (TTS)**.
